# CAP-06.S04 — Search Studio and transparent expansion

PRIVATE PROPOSAL; NO IMPLEMENTATION AUTHORITY.

## 0. Plan control

Private W3 replacement draft of `planning/slice-plans/CAP-06/CAP-06.S04-search-studio-and-transparent-expansion.md`. Original hash `a0d5ad91ab4c9a3c192a62dc56110563e7cf00a245c056f56268688ff8ba7286`. Current canonical status NOT_STARTED is unchanged. Wave-scoped execution; the schema's legacy planning_gate spelling does not recreate capability-campaign approval. All peers bind the single Wave packet.

## 1. Purpose and contribution to the larger vision

Researchers can iteratively broaden, narrow, branch, and compare searches without losing their reasoning history. Editable draft queries are distinct from immutable executed SearchRuns. Branches, translation loss and bounded citation/semantic expansion are visible user actions, not hidden model behavior.

## 2. Scope

Editable draft queries are distinct from immutable executed SearchRuns. Branches, translation loss and bounded citation/semantic expansion are visible user actions, not hidden model behavior.

Non-goals: hosted infrastructure, neural training,8/16GiB model workloads, optional W9 optimization, unapproved larger-compute W5 or new physical foreign-host proof. Do not implement future synthesis/writing/publication authority.

## 3. Authority, dependencies, and campaign stop conditions

Proposed dependencies: CAP-04.S02.T03, CAP-06.S03.T03. Inherit accepted ADR21/25/26/28/29 within remit, current Windows protected lifecycle and actual W2 exit/G2 prerequisite. New proposed architecture/reference must be accepted through normal planning before W3 approval. Unknown facts stay unknown; ordinary failures/debugging are not new owner gates.

## 4. Selected implementation decisions

Use the concrete proposed choices in this capability front matter and contracts-01.md. Relevant W3 decision register: CAP-06-D01, CAP-06-D02, CAP-06-D03, CAP-06-D04, CAP-06-D05, CAP-06-D06, CAP-06-D07, CAP-06-D08, CAP-06-D09, CAP-06-D10, CAP-06-D11, CAP-06-D12, CAP-06-D13, CAP-06-D14, CAP-06-D15, CAP-06-D16, CAP-06-D17, CAP-06-D18, CAP-06-D19, CAP-06-D20, CAP-06-D21, CAP-06-D22, CAP-06-D23. Recommended != accepted. Preserve four inherited CAP07 W1 decisions exactly.

## 5. Architecture and implementation design

- Existing desktop Search Studio and generated API
- Core SearchRun branch/translation commands
- Existing connector and corpus ports

Current paths only. Stable generated contracts/ports, canonical transaction+provenance/outbox and narrow worker authority; no second state store or runtime evaluation dependency. Exact new filenames remain task-selected, not asserted existing.

## 6. User experience and approved reference

The complete proposed reference is architecture-ux/ui-reference/ at this packet root. Actual1.9 is the inherited base, not approval of new W3 interactions; future reference ID/approval remain null. Preserve all14 semantic1.5 workflows. MetricPolicy03 applies only to its declared roles/tasks; shared existing parser/model reservation governs relevant runtime work without imposing a new metric on unrelated retrieval/screening.

Base RO-UI-ACADEMIC-MINIMAL-1.9, exact inherited semantic catalog1.5/14keys and source-first supporting-return behavior. Apply the material proposed W3 interaction delta only after ordinary reference adoption; do not implement mock7B/GPU32k/prices as defaults. See ux-reference-proposal-01.md for keyboard/focus/status/late result contracts.

## 7. Security, privacy, rights and research integrity

Before reads/dispatch/commit/replay: exact project/session/Intent/source rights+model-use/classification/budget. Source/model output untrusted; encrypted projections/cache, no implicit network/spend, human inclusion/ethics/interpretation/final claim. Prove the material real principal boundary, not mocks alone.

## 8. Failure, cancellation, restart and recovery

Cancel does not add a corpus member or erase parent runs; source-specific failures leave partial results labeled. Project lock/switch clears protected editor/results and invalidates late callbacks. Preserve prior accepted work, failed raw outputs and immutable actor/attempt identity. Normal owned cleanup is required for lifetime claims.

## 9. Task-by-task implementation plan

### CAP-06.S04.T01 — Build query editor, source selection, preview, and saved-run UI

Objective: Search Studio with fielded editor, source/index selectors, filters, counts, warnings, save/run/cancel, and result comparison.

Dependencies: CAP-06.S03.T03, CAP-04.S02.T03. Estimate: 24 engineering-effort-hours including 0 planned refactoring hours.

Original forecast acceptance retained:

- Exact executed queries remain visible; unsaved edits are distinguishable from executed runs; source failures are shown per adapter.
- Automated tests cover the expected path and at least one material failure or boundary condition.
- Relevant contracts, migrations, fixtures, documentation, and audit behavior are updated without unrelated scope expansion.

Explicit W3 adaptation/additional closure:

- Keyboard-accessible editor and per-source status, exact executed text and safe validation; preview alone issues no retrieval.

Ordered implementation:

1. Risk-selected task-start acceptance-closure; inspect current predecessor and material adverse findings; characterize the material boundary before production changes where practical.
2. Implement the bounded contract through existing Core/worker/generated ports; preserve immutable history and update compatibility/migration as needed.
3. Keyboard-accessible editor and per-source status, exact executed text and safe validation; preview alone issues no retrieval.
4. Commit then collect criterion-linked exact-candidate evidence with stable selected inputs/normal owned cleanup; independent task disposition and integration.

Evidence/review: Independent commit-bound task disposition; deeper review for policy, model/worker isolation, rights/egress, migrations, cross-process contracts and research-integrity changes. Machine-readable criterion/outcome map with actual candidate/source/runtime/fixtures and raw receipts; failures/skips/limits retained. Happy path plus the material denial/cancel/restart/recovery/rights/staleness cases selected by this task and contracts-01.md. Actual resource/timing/quality evidence for claims made; fixtures do not prove a real security or model boundary.


### CAP-06.S04.T02 — Implement versioned search-tree branches and query translation

Objective: Parent/child SearchRun relationships, annotations, database-specific translations, and side-by-side result-set differences.

Dependencies: CAP-06.S04.T01. Estimate: 20 engineering-effort-hours including 0 planned refactoring hours.

Original forecast acceptance retained:

- Users can fork without overwriting history; translations show unsupported clauses and semantic change warnings; additions/removals trace to a branch.
- Automated tests cover the expected path and at least one material failure or boundary condition.
- Relevant contracts, migrations, fixtures, documentation, and audit behavior are updated without unrelated scope expansion.

Explicit W3 adaptation/additional closure:

- Fork/compare uses stable parent identities and translation-loss reports; unsupported source clauses never silently vanish.

Ordered implementation:

1. Risk-selected task-start acceptance-closure; inspect current predecessor and material adverse findings; characterize the material boundary before production changes where practical.
2. Implement the bounded contract through existing Core/worker/generated ports; preserve immutable history and update compatibility/migration as needed.
3. Fork/compare uses stable parent identities and translation-loss reports; unsupported source clauses never silently vanish.
4. Commit then collect criterion-linked exact-candidate evidence with stable selected inputs/normal owned cleanup; independent task disposition and integration.

Evidence/review: Independent commit-bound task disposition; deeper review for policy, model/worker isolation, rights/egress, migrations, cross-process contracts and research-integrity changes. Machine-readable criterion/outcome map with actual candidate/source/runtime/fixtures and raw receipts; failures/skips/limits retained. Happy path plus the material denial/cancel/restart/recovery/rights/staleness cases selected by this task and contracts-01.md. Actual resource/timing/quality evidence for claims made; fixtures do not prove a real security or model boundary.


### CAP-06.S04.T03 — Implement citation, bibliographic-coupling, and semantic expansion actions

Objective: Explicit expansion operations from selected seeds or clusters, with depth/limits, expected rationale, preview, and provenance.

Dependencies: CAP-06.S04.T02. Estimate: 20 engineering-effort-hours including 0 planned refactoring hours.

Original forecast acceptance retained:

- Each discovered record identifies the seed and path; duplicate expansion is idempotent; depth limits and cancellation prevent runaway traversal.
- Automated tests cover the expected path and at least one material failure or boundary condition.
- Relevant contracts, migrations, fixtures, documentation, and audit behavior are updated without unrelated scope expansion.

Explicit W3 adaptation/additional closure:

- Expansion default depth1/limit100, hard cap1000 per explicit run; human preview and idempotent commit; no arbitrary URL/shell/model-issued connector calls.

Ordered implementation:

1. Risk-selected task-start acceptance-closure; inspect current predecessor and material adverse findings; characterize the material boundary before production changes where practical.
2. Implement the bounded contract through existing Core/worker/generated ports; preserve immutable history and update compatibility/migration as needed.
3. Expansion default depth1/limit100, hard cap1000 per explicit run; human preview and idempotent commit; no arbitrary URL/shell/model-issued connector calls.
4. Commit then collect criterion-linked exact-candidate evidence with stable selected inputs/normal owned cleanup; independent task disposition and integration.

Evidence/review: Independent commit-bound task disposition; deeper review for policy, model/worker isolation, rights/egress, migrations, cross-process contracts and research-integrity changes. Machine-readable criterion/outcome map with actual candidate/source/runtime/fixtures and raw receipts; failures/skips/limits retained. Happy path plus the material denial/cancel/restart/recovery/rights/staleness cases selected by this task and contracts-01.md. Actual resource/timing/quality evidence for claims made; fixtures do not prove a real security or model boundary.

## 10. Slice-wide verification matrix

Complete this slice outcome through actual predecessor ports and real Windows local UI/Core/worker boundaries. Selected evidence: exact/happy, denial/rights revoke, invalid schema/anchor, cancel/late completion, crash/restart, migration/rebuild, OOM/unsafe resource and keyboard/focus as applicable. Cross-slice checkpoints in wave-proposal-01.json do not add human gates. All measured claims cite actual raw/criterion/candidate and limits.

## 11. Performance and resource budgets

Use the explicit proposed initial-target-register-01.json, not old p95/max forecast prose as a new timing gate. Timing decisions use median of ALL comparable completed trials per workload/state/configuration; retain min/median/max/raw/conditions, failures and timeouts. Resource/quality/rights/security/cleanup limits remain hard. No spike attribution without evidence. Models obey the total application2GiB preferred/3GiB upper aggregate and per-role tiny/small admission; see aggregate-resource-and-selection-policy-02.json. All numeric choices are proposed initial engineering targets needing actual W3 validation, not measurements or RAM/model promises. Optional optimization remains W9.

## 12. Observability and provenance

Content-free operational trace IDs/hashes/sizes/status/actual use; durable scholarly source/task/schema/model/profile/policy/actor lineage in protected canonical records. Unknown confidence/usage explicit, no raw private content in default logs.

## 13. Adjacent-slice handoffs

The explicit task edges, parent-slice external dependency unions and ordered prior-slice approval gates in task-register-01.json/ordered-slice-feasibility-witness-05.json jointly govern this proposed execution; retain all original external predecessors. Canonical persistence precedes extraction commits, runtime authority precedes positive model tasks, verifier sampling precedes bulk verification, optional remote cannot block the complete local journey.

## 14. Migration and backward compatibility

Start at actual approved predecessor schema observed28; backup-first staged migration/row+cell+object preservation/interrupted rollback/read-only incompatible handling. Index/model/prompt/schema upgrades retain historic identities and stale derived generations. Never repair original recovery fixtures or mint legacy witnesses.

## 15. Required slice evidence bundle

Criterion-linked machine manifest, actual raw commands/outcomes, exact candidate/source/runtime/fixture/policy closure, declared gold/measurement rights and human annotations, real boundary proof where claimed, source/UX/risk-selected independent review, limits/deferred coverage and adverse history.

## 16. Definition of Ready

After W2 completion/G2, all proposed W3 peers/decisions/architecture/reference and estimates receive normal immutable complete-Wave approval; actual dependency-eligible task claimed through taskctl. Task-start work refines material acceptance, not a new approval packet.

## 17. Definition of Done

All original criteria plus explicit approved W3 adaptations measured/proven, actual task dispositions integrated, end-to-end slice evidence and independent slice judgment, no invented model/human/data or ignored adverse result. No slice/task completion is asserted here.

## 18. Risks and mitigations

Cancel does not add a corpus member or erase parent runs; source-specific failures leave partial results labeled. Project lock/switch clears protected editor/results and invalidates late callbacks. Small-model quality and real protected-index/runtime feasibility are unmeasured. Refuse unsupported roles, retain manual/lexical usefulness, report target failures and use ordinary consequential-evidence route; no silent security/performance waiver.

## 19. Required ADRs and human decisions

The three material unnumbered architecture topics and the W3 experience delta are ordinary proposed decisions, not accepted ADRs. Reuse accepted decisions within remit; exact normal record identities assigned at planning transition. No placeholder ADR-CAP reference is treated as accepted. The one Wave approval remains pending.

## 20. Research and standards basis

See primary-evidence-01.json plus the unchanged read inventory in genuine905b. Primary docs motivate choices but do not prove installed versions, data rights, model quality, resource fit or actual results.

## 21. AI implementation runbook

No execution now. After the complete W3 packet is approved, resume its same campaign; claim the next dependency-eligible task, perform risk-selected acceptance closure, characterize, implement, commit, collect exact-candidate selected proof, submit/review/integrate, then slice/checkpoint/Wave qualification. No capability ready/start command or new GRR/GCR/controller.

## Ordered-slice execution and proof ownership05

Execution position is 4 within proposed CAP-06 W3 order: CAP-06.S01, CAP-06.S02, CAP-06.S03, CAP-06.S04, CAP-06.S05, CAP-06.S06. Prior capability slices requiring actual independent APPROVED completion: CAP-06.S01, CAP-06.S02, CAP-06.S03. All tasks in this slice also wait for the exact external union: CAP-04.S02.T03, CAP-06.S03.T03. A task DAG alone is insufficient. No slice approval or READY state is manufactured.

## Canonical proposed-publication reconciliation

Actual W2/G2 initial completion is recorded at1cc8131d8b74cf6c536d48ce4badc25933981bbb; the current planning predecessor and committed post-exit roadmap is2e2f1a9d042c3dd8db3f8f31b648a36ad004c505. See artifacts/evidence/W2.initial-exit-recording-receipt-20261016-01.json and the independent Wave/S06/CP10 records. Historical3541 product,1b377 build/reference/Native,fc694 full90 and ownerf86 identities remain distinct. Initial1000 functional commit is qualified, but100k publication/fullmanifest/replay/reopen and continuous performance remain UNQUALIFIED; no1000 productcap or W3metadata/vector100k import-throughput inference. All failed/UNKNOWN/UNTESTED evidence, parser-only2.5333542s acceptance, source-search median7s/all24raws, strictClippyFAIL,409UNKNOWN, security expiry and platform/installer gaps remain. Owner933b moves optional cosmetics and optimization/performance intake to newW10; functional/security qualification residuals remain separately trackedW9, and larger-computing product workW5. Before W3 approval, suggested soft median timing overage strictly<7s may be accepted with W10 debt; completed comparable trials/allraws retained, failed/timeouts and hard functional/security/resource/cancellation bounds unchanged. Hosted university/cloud labels areW11/W12. All48IDs/16slices/924hours including28once, ordered proof ownership, policy03 metrics/token semantics and serial admission are retained. ADR0056–58/reference1.10 remain Proposed, active1.9 unchanged and W3approvalPENDING; no implementation is authorized.
